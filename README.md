# Indoor-COVID-19-Infection-Risk-Assessment-Model
The model was created using the open-source modeling software NetLogo. It is an indoor COVID-19 infection risk assessment model that can integrate multiple transmission routes, and can quickly predict the infection risk in buildings with frequent movement of people to help architects and managers make better decisions.
At the beginning of the model is the input panel, which covers both building interventions and behavioral interventions. The architectural interventions rely on the building design block for inputting building plan information and the ventilation design block for inputting ventilation conditions. The behavioral interventions include a customer control block, a checkout control block, and a sanitary control block, which regulate customer shopping behavior, checkout management, and hygiene behavior, respectively. Then comes the virus transmission module, which includes the air-based transmission block and the surface-based transmission block. Finally, there is a risk assessment block, followed by a logging block and a visualization block to record data and plot real-time images.
